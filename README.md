# satellite-microplastic-research

This is a research project conducted at Minerva AI Sustainability Lab in collaboration with The Nippion Foundation from Japan on the topic of predicting microplastic movement using satellite data from NASA. 

The satellite data is obtained from NASA's CYNGSS project and is directly downloaded from the website:
